# paprika-rs

A client for the [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com) API and API server for
other uses.

The Paprika API is designed for use in app and given it's unofficial nature,
probably shouldn't be used much. This attempts to sync everything with a
PostgreSQL database that can be used for other purposes.
